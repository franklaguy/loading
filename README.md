# loading

- this example js file can be added to any website without js conflicts
- the script checks for several scenario's involving when the DOM has been loaded
- please see the init funct comments for further explaination
- this file is only intended to be a sample and not a fully verbose js script 
- the application of this file is only recommended for testing and no other purpose
## NOTE
- I tested this against a Meteor site / cms I built (sixstrangetales.com) only, by working on this challenge I took the time to also test what I've built while considering these new concepts you've introduced to me and essentially kill two birds with one stone. I'm looking forward to discussing with you as well as learning more about the Merlin Guide extension. Thx. R. Lewis
